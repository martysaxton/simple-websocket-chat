Simple WebSocket Chat
=====================


This project demonstrates how to use WebSockets to implement a rudimentary chat service.

The server side uses SpringFramework's support for WebSockets and STOMP.  It uses spring-boot to keep things tidy.

The client side is a very basic  single page that uses jQuery, stomp and socksjs.
